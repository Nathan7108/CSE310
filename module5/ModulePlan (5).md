### Software Description 
A simple drawing and painting web app built with TypeScript. Users can draw on a canvas with different brush sizes and colors. The app will include a color picker, brush size slider, clear button, undo functionality, and the ability to save drawings as images. It will have a clean, simple interface that works well on desktop and mobile browsers.

### Create a Schedule
Create a detailed schedule using the table below to complete your selected module during this Sprint.  Include details such as what (task), when (time), where (location), and duration.  You should also include time to work on your team project.  You are expected to spend 16 hours every Sprint working on your individual module, team project, and other activities. Time spent on this individual module should be at least 10 hours.

|             |First Week|Second Week|
|-------------|----------|-----------|
|**Monday**   | Set up TypeScript project, create canvas and basic drawing (2 hours) | Add color picker and brush size controls (1 hour) |
|**Tuesday**  | Implement clear and undo functionality (2 hours) | Add save/download image feature (1 hour) |
|**Wednesday**| Polish UI and add mobile touch support (2 hours) | Testing and bug fixes (1 hour) |
|**Thursday** | Add extra features like different brush shapes (1 hour) | Create video demo and documentation (2 hours) |
|**Friday**   | Team project work (1 hour) | Final UI polish and features (1 hour) |
|**Saturday** | Write README and documentation (1 hour) | Final testing and GitHub push (1 hour) |


### Identify Risks
Identify at least two risks that you feel will make it difficult to succeed in this module.  Identify an action plan to overcome each of these risks.

||Risk|Action Plan|
|-|-|-|
|1|Canvas drawing might not work smoothly on touch devices | Test touch events early, use pointer events API for better mobile support |
|2|TypeScript setup and configuration could be confusing | Follow a simple TypeScript tutorial first, start with basic setup and add complexity later |
