### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
  Following online tutorials and documentation worked well for learning Flask and web development concepts.
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  Not planning the project structure beforehand led to some reorganization of files during development.
- How can you improve in the next module?
  I will create a detailed project plan before starting development and break down tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
