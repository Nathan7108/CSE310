### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
  Organizing code into separate files (snake.js, ai.js, game.js) made it easier to work with. Using classes helped structure the code.
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  The AI algorithm was harder than expected. Had to simplify it to get it working.
- How can you improve in the next module?
  Start testing features earlier instead of building everything first.
