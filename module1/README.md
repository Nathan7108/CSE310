# Overview

As a software engineer, I wanted to deepen my understanding of database management and authentication systems by building a complete user management application. This project demonstrates my learning journey in implementing secure authentication with proper database design and SQL operations.

I developed a comprehensive authentication system using Python and SQLite that handles user registration, secure login, and full CRUD operations. The system includes password hashing, input validation, and a professional menu interface to demonstrate real-world application development skills.

My purpose for writing this software was to master database operations, understand security best practices for user authentication, and learn how to structure a complete application with proper separation of concerns between the database layer and user interface.

# Development Environment

I used Python 3.6+ with built-in modules including sqlite3 for database operations, hashlib for password hashing, and getpass for secure password input.
